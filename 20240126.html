<p>Welcome to Episode IV of <strong>Will's Guide</strong>. This year, I've decided to make
1,024 videos - I've upped the number from a thousand, because I think two to the
tenth or one kiloTube of videos is more fun!</p>
<p>I've also set up the Discord server, and we've had about a dozen people join.
If you're interested in joining the Discord server <em>The Imperishable Wonderland of
Infinite Fun</em>, please email me.</p>
<p>Today, I'd like to talk about something close to my
heart: Scheme, a language which I love. And I'm just going to talk a little bit
about how you might learn Scheme. I'm going to have a whole bunch of videos on Scheme (I hope),
but how do you learn about Scheme? What are the resources available?
Let's just talk about a few of them I found useful..</p>

<h3 id="the-little-schemer-by-dan-friedman-and-matthias-felleisen"><a class="header" href="#the-little-schemer-by-dan-friedman-and-matthias-felleisen"><em>The Little Schemer</em> by Dan Friedman and Matthias Felleisen</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262560993/the-little-schemer/">The Little Schemer (MIT Press)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_P._Friedman">Dan's Wikipedia Entry</a></li>
<li><a href="https://felleisen.org/matthias/">Felleisen.org Site</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Felleisen">Matthias' Wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One is called <a name="a001"></a><em>The Little Schemer</em> by <a name="a002"></a>Daniel P Friedman and
<a name="a003"></a>Matthias Felleisen.
Dan was my adviser at Indiana University for my PhD, and he was also Matthias's adviser.
You also might know Matthias from the <a name="a004"></a>Racket world, so you have two experts guiding
you.</p>
<p>This book is really about thinking computationally, and specifically thinking about <em>recursion</em> - recursion over
lists and trees - those sorts of things, and also a little interpreter work. So, if you think is is going to be a
book that's a big thick manual on Scheme - the programming language and the semantics or whatever - well, you might be
disappointed. But this really in another way is at the heart of thinking about Scheme computationally and thinking
about computation and recursion, so it's a great book to affect your thinking and
make sure that you're really comfortable with ideas about recursion.</p>
<p>So this is recommended by me if you want to learn how to think recursively at least a certain way of thinking recursively.
If you're not comfortable with recursion, if you read this book and if you learn Scheme in general, you're likely to become very
comfortable with recursion, because Scheme is really based on recursion. There's no loop constructs like there
are in most languages (or anything does look like a loop, it's actually tail recursion which we'll talk about later)..</p>
<p>So it's sort of the secret that Scheme doesn't really have loops in the way most languages do, although it turns out you
can implement loops that are equivalent to a certain type of recursion..</p>

<p>Another great resource is <a name="a005"></a><em>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</em> by <a name="a006"></a>Harold Abelson and <a name="a007"></a>Gerald J Sussman with Julie
Sussman.  This is very famous as maybe the greatest textbook in the history of
computer science - it was used as the introductory textbook at MIT for many
years. It has all sorts of interesting ideas about computation and interpreters -
how to write interpreters, how you write a program that interprets another program,
those sorts of ideas, computational models. Great book, full of deep fascinating ideas.</p>
<p>Once again not a manual on Scheme - Scheme is introduced as needed as a computational
notation which really gets back to the heart of Lisp, the Lisp family of languages. You
need to have some sort of notation to talk about computation, so let's have a
very elegant, simple, minimal notation that's compositional, has nice properties,
and we can think about that's at the heart of Scheme, and that's one reason I really like
Scheme.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090">MIT 6.001 1986 Lectures on YouTube</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There's a series of videos based on the ideas in the books called the
<a name="a008"></a><em>SICP Lectures</em> and if you're interested in the book you
might like these videos.</p>
<p>I will say that the videos can be - and the book can be - a little mathy, especially in terms of the
examples. They aim towards the MIT entering class, or in this case, for these lectures I
don't know if these are supposed to be more experienced programmers or whatever, but it can turn
people off a little bit. So if you find that this is a little hard going, maybe start
with something like <em>The Little Schemer</em> first, which is really written for the bright high school student,
but the ideas are very deep and powerful, and can benefit anyone. So maybe start with something
like <em>The Little Schemer</em>, and if you feel that's not enough, you could try <a name="a009"></a><em>The Reasoned Schemer</em>
which is a much harder book, but in any case you could build yourself up towards the ideas in SICP
over time.</p>

<!--
there's a followon book intellectually a followon book called
4:59
software designed for flexibility how to avoid programming yourself into a corner by Chris Hansen and Gerald J susman this
5:06
is metaphorically the advanced version or the advanced followup of structure
5:11
interpretation computer programs is really about how do you write software how do
5:18
you write complicated programs in such a way that if you want to make a significant change to the program you don't have to throw away all your code
5:25
and start over again which turns out to be quite tricky so the book uses a bunch
5:30
of techniques people in the scheme and lisp community and AI communities have
5:37
developed over a long period of time to make software more flexible okay
5:44
so it's full of really interesting techniques should probably talk about that at some
5:49
point once again not a book on scheme but it contains a lot of really Advanced
5:56
uses of scheme you can learn a lot by looking at this book
6:01
book if you want something maybe closer to a
6:06
traditional textbook there's simply scheme by Brian Harvey and Matthew
6:11
Wright now you could see the second edition is from 1999 so it's you know quarter of a
6:18
century old scheme has changed so forth but the basic ideas
6:24
will be similar so there there are some other introductory textbooks on scheme
6:29
you find most of them are kind of out of date in terms of the specific language features but the important thing is how
6:37
you think about the language you can learn about the new um variants of
6:43
scheme over time there are also a bunch of papers
6:49
that you can you can find on scheme there's a scheme and functional programming Workshop it's been held for
6:56
a number of years you 2000 um hopefully there'll be a 2024 one happening soon
7:03
I'm on the steering committee for this workshop and I've organized it uh several times so if you look at one of
7:11
these workshops like from last year you can find the program and the accepted
7:18
papers and you know this sort of thing you know so here's a pre-print and you
7:25
find this is a recorded talk on um designing a language for learning
7:31
continuations you can find the video online you know lots of lots of good
7:37
resources there you know this is going to be more advanced of course than a
7:42
textbook but this is where a lot of the ideas get percolated or or more like
7:49
disseminated through the community is through papers or researchers talking to
7:56
each other if you don't have access to researchers talking to each other if you're not in grad school if you're not a working academic if you're not a
8:04
scheme implementer then reading papers is probably the best thing to do
8:11
certainly one of the best things to do now because of the internet and the web there are lots and lots of videos you
8:16
can watch and learn things that way as well and of course communicate with people via forums
8:22
and all the amazing things that we have now U speaking of forums you know
8:28
there's Lambda the ultimate the programming languages web log which used to be
8:34
more active I don't know to what extent is active these days but there's a
8:39
period in time where this was a really important resource for people trying to understand functional
8:45
programming and there's a group of papers here called Lambda the ultimate papers where the website got its name
8:52
and you so Lambda the ultimate imperative for example uh I don't know what will happen
9:00
if I try opening that let's see how about that one yeah let's try
9:08
it I have no idea oh okay well anyway these are
9:14
papers with gu steel and Jerry susman these the original Lambda the ultimate papers Lambda the ultimate X these are
9:22
papers that were describing scheme and using scheme or using lisp to solve
9:27
different types of problems and looking at list per scheme from different perspectives so these are classic papers
9:34
introduction Lambda calculus okay go-to statement considered harmful by dyra
9:39
whole bunch of interesting papers essence of compiling continuations so you know these are uh classic papers in
9:47
functional programming in programming languages that are worth taking a look at and many of these are involving
9:54
scheme or some version of list
9:59
there's also this scheme. org website there at least used to be a website called read scheme I don't know if that
10:06
still exist but you know scheme's been around long enough that websites come
10:11
and go the scheme. org website seems to have lots of lots of useful
10:17
resources uh and you can see that there are different standards and implementations so forth great things
10:25
about Community books
10:30
here is a scheme bibliography on GitHub and this lists all sorts of uh Lambda
10:39
papers and papers on Macros well maybe it
10:48
doesn't fail what's going on here I don't know like I said scheme's been
10:54
around a long time so I don't know why these things aren't working see does that open okay here we go maybe it's was
10:59
just a bad link maybe it's just a bad link so you know there are lots and lots
11:06
of papers on different topics like reflection you know a bunch of really
11:11
interesting papers on reflection and scheme um we'll talk about those
11:18
too all right another way if you really want to learn scheme is to start looking
11:23
at the standards like R5 RS that's the revised revised Revis Revis Revis
11:32
report on the algorithmic language scheme so there's this tradition of
11:38
having revised repeated a bunch of times so R6 RS add one more Revis at the
11:44
beginning so be revised to the sixth power R7 RS which is standards currently being developed has revised to the
11:52
seventh power so that's if you hear people talk about R R5 R RS R six r s
11:59
they might just call it R six they're talking about different versions of the scheme specification
12:06
standard um R5 RS was the standard that was in place when I started uh graduate
12:13
school and when I started studying scheme in a serious way normally you
12:18
hear about people talking about R4 RS R5 RS R6 RS R7 RS our 7 RS is broken into
12:25
two parts a large and a small but those are the standard things you hear
12:31
about so if someone's talking about R5 RS scheme that's what they're referring to they're referring to that version of
12:37
scheme and you can get the report which is pretty short it's 50 pages long this
12:43
is a beautiful document the R5 document oh I love it one of my favorite
12:49
documents in computation and you know it has an index it
12:55
has a denotational semantics which has some problems um but you know it
13:01
contains a complete semantics for the programming language and an
13:06
index and descriptions of the core features of language and the syntax and all that and examples and the whole
13:14
thing's 50 pages long so you can read 50 pages it's not that long there'll be things you don't understand but there'll
13:20
be lots of things you do understand because this written actually very well and if you you know take a scheme
13:26
interpreter or scheme compiler and you try going through the examples
13:31
with your scheme compiler you can get a lot of mileage just from reading through this
13:37
document more recently there's the revised revised revised revised revised
13:44
revised I think I got that right report on the algorithmic language scheme revised to the six power or
13:50
r6rs and you can find on R6 rs.
13:56
org um different versions of the specification now for R six they broke
14:03
up the specification into both the language
14:08
specification and the standard libraries so this is a bigger version of scheme
14:13
significantly bigger than RS R5 RS it's somewhat controversial that it was so
14:19
big now compared to a language like Java it's tiny but it's still much bigger
14:27
than R5 which was bigger than R4 and there are some people in the scheme Community who love the tiny tiny tiny
14:33
core language that's easy to implement easy to teach easy to understand and there's some people who want a pragmatic
14:40
practical language for everyday programming practical tasks they want a bigger language R six you know they
14:47
found something of a middle ground that didn't make everyone happy maybe it made
14:52
no one happy but that was the approach taken for our six and so they broke the standard libraries into a different
14:59
document and they also have these non-normative appendices and rationale
15:04
this is great if you want to understand how a language is designed so this is a
15:09
discussion about why they did certain things okay so not only is there a a
15:15
specification and in this case a different type of semantics this I believe is operational semantics but
15:22
they also talk about why they made these decisions I think that's pretty
15:28
interesting um now you know if you want to you know
15:33
get your hands on a specification and understand it what I probably would recommend is starting with R5 Just
15:40
because it's so small R5 RS doesn't really describe things like hygienic
15:45
macros in a lot of depth and there are some things that you know are frankly
15:51
mistakes in or or oversights in the spec so I wouldn't say
15:57
that this is the final word even for the R5 version however it's so small and
16:03
it's so well written that I think it's a great way to get a handle on what a spec
16:08
looks like or you could just dive into R six um but just be aware that the this
16:15
is a bigger language and and specifies a lot more and you know this libraries
16:21
part is large as well so um okay and then there's an r s which I was talking
16:29
about which is still being developed there's a small language and a large
16:34
language so like I said there was some controversy over R6 RS because it was a
16:39
bigger standard than R5 and yet it didn't include things like threads
16:46
didn't include lots of information about dealing with the operating system and you know the web so uh people who wanted
16:54
to use scheme as a a teaching language or as a language where they could easily
17:01
hack up an implementation and play around with ideas that way some of those people weren't so happy with r six
17:08
because it was bigger and complicated more complicated than R5 harder to implement harder to teach and at the
17:15
same time people who want to do web programming let's say uh or create a video game and scheme and interact with
17:22
Graphics or whatever uh complicated thing they wanted to do they weren't happy because R6 RS didn't specify that
17:31
but what R6 RS did specify was a library system where people could at least in
17:38
theory write code that could be uh modularized and maybe ported between
17:44
different implementations before R6 RS there really wasn't a chance to port code easily between scheme
17:51
implementations so R six was a step in that direction and r s it's a reaction
17:57
to some extent I think against R six where they say okay let's have a small language for the people who want a tiny
18:04
Jewel like Gem of a language that's easy to implement easy to understand they can
18:12
hack it to their heart's contempt for uh you know programming languages research or whatever they want to do they can
18:18
have the small language and for the people who want to have a really big language they have the big language so
18:25
they split up the spec which is interesting idea what's happened in practice is that
18:32
the small language design was completed in 2013 the large language design is
18:38
still going on so 11 years after the small um language was finished and I
18:44
guess this was sort of a you know almost a guaranteed outcome when you're trying
18:50
to make a much bigger version of the language um that's not supported by a
18:56
bunch of Industry you know and and government research Labs or whatever
19:04
so um this this spec is still going on you will see for any individual scheme
19:12
implementation it's likely to say which version of the spec is supported they support R4 RS they support R5 R six R7
19:20
R7 small nothing supports R7 large completely because that spec is still
19:26
being developed scheme um currently supports R6
19:32
RS uh and even for something like R6 RS or R5 RS you'll often see that an
19:40
individual specification or sorry individual implementation will describe differences
19:46
from the spec so in fact for some versions of the specification the the
19:52
specification itself is internally inconsistent and it's impossible to implement
19:58
a a correct version or at least people have made that argument that it's impossible to create a fully conforming
20:06
implementation um also there are some subtleties in the spec that you know
20:12
make a little bit of a design and implementation tradeoff to decide to
20:18
implement every single thing in the spec so many implementations will say they're
20:23
they Implement R NRS whatever n is um modulo this one little feature what have
20:31
you okay so those are the the language specs and it's really important if
20:37
you're going to use scheme or any other language to be comfortable with the
20:43
definition of the language I think nice thing about scheme is this the the specification is actually pretty
20:50
small if you want to learn C++ or Java those specifications are quite
20:56
complicated although C++ they seem to be um maybe simplifying uh Java still seems to be
21:04
getting more complicated in a way although they are adding abstractions that hopefully are
21:10
helpful okay another way to learn about scheme is to read this book this is a
21:17
book I refer to all the time which is called the scheme programming language fourth edition by Kent diig who's
21:23
creator of sha scheme and who also was the editor of
21:30
r6rs uh that spec and so this is describing in the fourth edition um you
21:36
know basically r6rs scheme but instead of describing it in a very formal way it
21:43
is describing scheme you know from the standpoint of examples and
21:50
motivation and uh gives just gives a lot more detail so this is you know it's not
21:55
it's not really a textbook or tutorial alth although it has aspects of that um you know if you didn't know how to
22:01
program at all I think this would be a hard book to learn programming from but it's a great book to go to to try to
22:10
understand what the specification is trying to say so if there's part of r6rs that's complicated
22:16
or you just don't know about a feature at all if you read about it in this book
22:22
and then look at the spec then look at r6rs then that will give you much better
22:28
idea of what's going on and since Kent you know was um the editor for for the
22:36
r6rs process he understands what the motivation was and he's also an implementer so he knows inside and out
22:44
not just the motivation from the specification process but how at least
22:49
Shay scheme implements um those parts of the language or at least how how Shay
22:55
scheme implemented it when he wrote This Book very very useful resource the book's
23:01
very well written another companion guide that
23:07
goes to that is the Shay scheme users guide so like I said Kent diig is a
23:13
creator of sha scheme and he has a users guide which now uh I guess other people
23:20
have contributed um maybe to this guide certainly originally I think this was written by Kent and it ties to
23:28
the scheme programming language book these are cross referenced with each other very helpful so if you're using sh
23:34
scheme which is the implementation along with racket that I use most
23:39
often of of scheme or scheme like language then this is a very helpful
23:45
guide and because it cross references with this uh book talking about r6rs you
23:53
can learn a lot about the language the spec and about how Shay does things and
23:59
where Shay differs from the specification so two really useful
24:04
resources one thing that's changed since when I started grad school let's say at
24:10
Indiana was that sha scheme which is always been known as a highquality scheme implementation used to be
24:18
commercial software that you had to pay an expensive license to be able to
24:24
run uh Cisco ended up purchasing sha scheme and
24:29
getting um Kent and other sheay hackers uh to work with them on a project for a
24:36
number of years so you can see that this users guide is actually from Cisco and
24:41
Cisco eventually released Shay scheme Version 9 as open source software under
24:48
an open source license so now you can run the full version of shaem the full compiled version whereas before you
24:54
could only use The Interpreter and Shas schem is now available on GitHub so I
25:01
use sha scheme a lot and will'll be using Shay scheme at least some of these videos and so here you can see the Cisco
25:09
dogubayazit
25:27
night when I Was preparing for a video or preparing to make a bunch of videos I
25:34
started going through some of this documentation in the Sha scheme uh guide
25:40
and in particular I wanted to learn how to use a sha scheme debugger better sh scheme has an integrated debugger it
25:46
also has tracing facilities all sorts of nice features but I've never really been
25:52
comfortable using debugger partly because when I was in grad school the debugger didn't work that well because I
25:58
only had access to The Interpreter not the compiler the debugger really is much
26:03
better if you had the compiler for a Shas gem which I have access to now because it's open source so I want to go
26:09
back and learn about the debugger when I was reading the debugging section I noticed that well
26:16
probably because this was written 10 10 or more years ago maybe 15 years ago now
26:23
um there's this dead link to how to debug Shay scheme programs for fortunately someone has uh you know
26:32
found Kent's instructions on how to debug sha scheme programs and you can find it online for
26:39
GitHub and I found some other little typos I think this is a typo Trace let
26:44
may be used to trace ordinary Le Expressions as well as Le Expressions that I think is a typo I
26:52
don't know a little confused here's something looks like a copy and paste
26:57
error box inspector objects box inspector objects contain sha scheme boxes okay and then TLC inspector
27:04
objects box inspector objects contain Shay scheme boxers boxes that looks like a copy and paste error to me and I
27:12
didn't even know by the way what a TLC inspector object was i' never heard of that it looks like that's coming from
27:19
this paper um my friend disease galom and Kent wrote on um generation friendly
27:26
EQ table so scheme EQ is pointer equality generation friendly has to do
27:32
with generational garbage collection I mean we talk about that um but it turns
27:40
out that these TLC things are temp transport link cells I never heard of
27:45
that term before um has to do with the way they Implement these hash tables so this documentation is a transport link
27:53
cell inspector object I think there's just a little copy and paste mistake and uh I think I found one or
28:02
two other typos because sha scheme is now you know
28:09
open source and you can find um not just the code for sha scheme but also the Sha
28:16
scheme users guide and along with that you know the
28:21
scheme programming language fourth edition all these files are here we can go and we can look at the bug
28:30
um which is like a scheme version of tech I believe that Kent came up with
28:35
this is like a scheme Tech and it turns out that sure enough uh these typos what
28:42
I believe are typos are or old URLs are in the documentation and I don't know if Kent's
28:49
still maintaining this or not but there are people still working on Sha scheme and and in particular the racket people
28:56
are rebuilding they've rebuilt racket on top of Shay so they're active in keeping
29:01
Shay up to date and then some of the people who worked on Shay at Cisco like
29:07
Andy keep or are still you know keeping an eye on it and making updates so I
29:13
emailed Andy to ask um what should I do should I do a poll request or you know
29:19
send him or someone else the typos I've found so that especially when you're
29:25
part of a small community but reading books as well is a service that I think is important so not only you know do you
29:33
hopefully uh feel comfortable reading specifications and reading formal
29:39
documentation reading books but if you find an error it's really helpful to the
29:45
authors if you could report that error somehow so that's what I'm going to do to try to be a good citizen in uh the
29:53
Shay scheme world to try to report these little uh typos you know there's nothing
29:59
here I couldn't easily understand so I don't think it's a any sort of deep error but let's go ahead and you know
30:05
try to correct all those so if you're reading documentation and you think
30:10
something's an error now if you don't know the language well if you don't know the documentation well then maybe it's
30:17
hard to tell so maybe ask someone else first but if you're pretty sure it's just a typo maybe go ahead and email the
30:24
person who created it or send a poll request and that's one way we can try to
30:32
make these languages and documentation and tutorials books uh better over
30:40
time so that is just a quick overview of
30:46
some resources for learning scheme and you know the importance I
30:51
think of learning spec you know from the uh official specification trying to read
30:57
those the scheme spec is very short so if you're interested in scheme I
31:03
recommend maybe starting with r five or just starting with r six you could do r
31:08
s small and trying to trying to read those specs you could read all of them if you if you're really into it trying
31:15
to see how far you can get understanding it and in the intro to R5 and I don't
31:21
know how how old this intro is there's this marvelous
31:28
philosophical statement about the design of scheme how the the philosophy behind
31:34
scheme's design you know in particular I love this sentence programming languages should be designed not by piling feature
31:41
on top of feature but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make
31:46
additional features appear necessary I love it scheme demonstrates
31:52
a very small number of rules for forming expressions with no restrictions on how they or compos suffice to form a
32:00
practical and efficient programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming
32:05
paradigms in use today oh very strong sense of design I love it this is very
32:11
different from say the design of java okay very
32:17
different um so it's interesting when you're learning languages or thinking about languages comp you know compare
32:23
and contrast the philosophies of language and then the languages change over time are they you know are they
32:32
keeping up with this philosophy or are they changing somehow I think certainly through R5 scheme had this philosophy
32:40
some people I think said that R six maybe went too far away from being this
32:45
minimum language with the smallest number of features R seven small is more
32:51
like this philosophy whether or not the larger versions are more useful
32:58
that's an interesting question any case um I hope you will take a look at the R5
33:05
report and see if you can make sense of that parts of it are very easy to read
33:11
parts of it are kind of complicated and if you're not familiar with denotational semantics well it's going to be really
33:16
hard to read if uh you don't know anything about hygienic scheme macros going to be hard to read but we can talk
33:22
about some of those topics in these videos all right see you soon I got
33:28
1,020 videos to make bye-bye
